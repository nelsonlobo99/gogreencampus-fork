# GoGreenCampus

This is a retired college project, made furiously by [Nelson Lobo](https://github.com/nelsonlobo99) and I, after our [Laser Communications Projects](https://gitlab.com/5b43f91c61170e88de567951ebbec765/laser-communications-system) got rejected for being "too complicated" (lmao). 

<b>Note</b>: This project is not officially approved by any health, environment or government organization in any way. It relies purely on [quik mafs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zexg3wFN70).

### What's this?

GoGreenCampus is an open-source Android application to track waste disposal in college campuses and business parks. It features a Black theme (because we care about your eyes). It was designed to be simple, so that everyone from Janitors to Sanitation Engineers can use it.

### How to install?

You can grab the APK file [here](https://gitlab.com/5b43f91c61170e88de567951ebbec765/gogreencampus/raw/master/Prebuilt%20APKs/app-debug.apk?inline=false). You can also clone to your computer and build, modify and play around with it, and don't forget to create a branch and update it here, to showcase your creativity.
